"""secure_agg.py — the secure-aggregation contract (Bonawitz et al. 2017, ACM CCS,
doi:10.1145/3133956.3133982), so the server learns only Σ ΔW, never any individual ΔW.

This is the CANONICAL copy of the protocol. The Roger client (`roger.federated.secure_agg` in the
main repo) carries the same SCALE/R/quantize/mask; it omits `dequantize` (server-only). Any change to
SCALE, R, the sorted-key flatten layout, or the SHAKE PRG must be made on BOTH sides in lockstep or
the masks stop cancelling. The server itself only calls `dequantize` + `R`; `quantize`/`mask` are kept
here because they ARE the contract the server's dequantize must invert, and the tests drive them to
prove mask-cancellation against the very code the server relies on.

Each user i uploads, in fixed-point integers mod R:

    g_i = q(ΔW_i) + Σ_k ε_{ik}·(2·1_{i>k} − 1)   (mod R)

where ε_{ik} = ε_{ki} is a *pairwise* noise vector both parties derive locally from their shared
X25519 (EC-DH) secret — never transmitted — expanded to payload length by a SHAKE-256 PRG. The sign
term (+1 for the larger participant id, −1 for the smaller, ordered by raw public key) is
antisymmetric, so when the server sums every g_i each pair's masks cancel exactly and Σ g_i = Σ q(ΔW_i).
Working mod R is what makes a single g_i uniform over Z_R (the privacy guarantee); the cancellation
itself is exact regardless. The client quantizes→masks; the server dequantizes after summing.
